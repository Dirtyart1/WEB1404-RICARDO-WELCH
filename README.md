**Name:** Ricardo welch

**student number:** 9622951

**course:** WEB1403



### Introduction
Since that start o this course I have learnt so many useful things about design and coding that I didnt already know, it has also opened up my eyes to things that I might want to try in the future to do with the web that I have never really concidered before. Overall its been a brilliant couple of months and im looking forward to what the next 2 years have to offer me.


####[EYE BOMBING](https://github.com/TresFriends/EyeBombing)

This was the first project that we did and I really enjoyed it becasue it allowed me to the world in a different light, becasue now when I look at something I try and key in on the small minute details of something.


####[ONE TWEET](https://github.com/Dirtyart1/one-tweet-research)

One tweet is one of my favourite projects becasue it wasn't a group project and you could work at your own paste also you didnt have to rely on oter people for work wich was a big bonus and you could do it in your own time. one other thing that I really enjoyed about this project is that it was simple and straight forward.


####[UNION HACK](https://github.com/Mhossain360/FLAG-3/blob/master/Presentation.md)

Union hack was a fun project becasue you got to deface flags and vandalisim is always fun when you have a reason for it aslo even though it was a group project you still could work sort of independantly to create your flag.


####[CODE ON YOUR PLATE](https://github.com/Dirtyart1/WEB14103-Ricardo-Welch)

Code on your plate for me was by far the harest project that we've done so far because of the coding aspect of it but it was still fun and I created something that im very proud of which is my lasagna [Recipe](https://thimbleprojects.org/dirtyart1/145118).
